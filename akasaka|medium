Let me know if I’m wrong, but whoever writes here enjoys writing, right?

I do. I love writing. It’s a very cheap and accessible form of creativity: all you need is a pen and paper (or a branch and a muddy ground).

Writing on a notebook wasn’t sustainable for me. I always wanted to document my writing in a digital format so I could go back and see how creative I was.

I used to have a blog on Wordpress and I hated it (no offense). Maybe it was because I didn’t know how to format it well or I chose the wrong typography, 
the blog looked like a primitive cave painting with hieroglyphs carved on the wall. Zero readability.

Then I discovered Medium.

Medium is not only darn easy to use, but it also has a huge, vibrant and supportive community. After I published my first blog post here, 
I decided to stick with it for a while.

is a pretty nice site, you can write whatever you want and make a few articles your life journal.
